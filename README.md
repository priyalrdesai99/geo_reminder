INTRODUCTION

In the ever-evolving landscape of mobile applications, the Geo-Reminder project endeavors to revolutionize task management by introducing a sophisticated location-aware system. Central to this endeavor is the Maps UI and Google Maps API Integration component, a pivotal element designed to provide users with a seamless and visually engaging experience. 

OVERVIEW OF WORK DONE

In my role for the Geo-Reminder project, I spearheaded the creation of a visually appealing Maps UI, elevating the user experience by seamlessly integrating the Google Maps API. This encompassed developing intuitive navigation controls, real-time user location monitoring, and crafting an interface that displays directions to stores. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in all aspects requiring Google Maps API integration, ensuring a cohesive and immersive mapping experience. My efforts extended to live user location monitoring, a foundational element crucial for both providing directions and facilitating the geofencing algorithm developed by a team member. Overall, my contributions centered around enhancing the application's visual appeal, user interaction, and location-based functionalities. To test my work standalone I have created a simple activity which has a button which when pressed shows the user's live location. Moreover I have added a source and destination input box. When you enter both and press on get directions. The Maps UI that I created appears, which shows the path, the destination and time required to reach your destination.
